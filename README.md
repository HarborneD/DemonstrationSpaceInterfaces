# AirBus-DemoHub

#Current Proof of concepts included:

Leap motion control of VR Screens.
- Using left hand gestures to signify screen number and right hand gestures for actions
- pointing to signify screen number and right hand gestures for actions
- using an "on arm" menu to select screen number and take actions

Possible Solutions:
VR
Models of projects that can be picked up , decomposed (Plane with roof that can be pulled off to look inside)
TVs controlled using Leap Motion, Kinect, Vive Controllers
TVs play only when looking at them (certain degree either side)
Environments that can be walked around and interacted with (not just a demo space area)

Real World
All TVs controlled by one leap motion, either on a desk on in the centre of the room. (Command signals sent to the devices displaying the media).
TVs controlled by Kinect (one per TV, person walks in front of TV and gains control of playback)
