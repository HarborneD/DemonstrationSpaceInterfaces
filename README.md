#Exploring emerging user interface design techniques and technologies within a demonstration space setting. 

###Current Proof of concepts included in this repo:


Leap motion control of VR Screens - Unity + Leap Motion + HTC Vive (click for videos):
- [Using left hand gestures to signify screen number and right hand gestures for actions](https://vimeo.com/harborned/leapmotionconcept-lefthandcountpinch)

- [pointing to signify screen number and right hand gestures for actions](https://vimeo.com/harborned/leapmotionconcept-pointpinch)

- [using an "on arm" menu to select screen number and take actions](https://vimeo.com/harborned/leapmotionconcept-menu)


###Possible directions to explore:<br />
VR<br />
- 3D models of Airbus projects that can be picked up, decomposed (i.e. a plane with roof that can be pulled off to look inside)<br />
- Virtual TVs controlled using Leap Motion, Kinect, Vive Controllers<br />
- TVs that play only when looking at them (certain degree either side)<br />
- Environments that can be walked around and interacted with (not just a demo space area, i.e. inside of a plane)<br />

Real World<br />
- All TVs controlled by one leap motion, either on a desk on in the centre of the room. (Command signals sent to the devices displaying the media).
- TVs controlled by Kinect (one Kinect per TV, person walks in front of TV and gains control of playback)
