# AirBus-DemoHub

#Current Proof of concepts included:

Leap motion control of VR Screens.
- Using left hand gestures to signify screen number and right hand gestures for actions
- pointing to signify screen number and right hand gestures for actions
- using an "on arm" menu to select screen number and take actions

Possible Solutions:<br />
VR<br />
- Models of projects that can be picked up , decomposed (Plane with roof that can be pulled off to look inside)<br />
- TVs controlled using Leap Motion, Kinect, Vive Controllers<br />
- TVs play only when looking at them (certain degree either side)<br />
- Environments that can be walked around and interacted with (not just a demo space area)<br />

Real World<br />
- All TVs controlled by one leap motion, either on a desk on in the centre of the room. (Command signals sent to the devices displaying the media).
- TVs controlled by Kinect (one per TV, person walks in front of TV and gains control of playback)
